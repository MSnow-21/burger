Project Description: The Burger (Eat-Da-Burger) application utilizes the MVC (Model, View, Controller) that generates a web engine to used to make database querys, return get requests to the user, and post user content to the web api. In this particular MVC, a database of burger names is used to keep track of the burgers names, and whether or not they have been devoured. Adding a burger adds the name specified of that burger list where the burgers have not been eaten. Pressing the "Devoured" button takes that named burger off that list, and then moves it to a list of burgers not eaten.
